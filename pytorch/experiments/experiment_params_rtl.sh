# Simulation parameters

# Requirements for RTL simulation:
# in definitions.py:
#   1 - set FI_GEMM = True
#   2 - set GL_INJECTION = False

#
# The experiment report files. Those are placed in the folder reports/$model/$experiment. Each experiment type should be placed in its own folder
#
experiment="exp-outputs-RTL-v1"

#
# The Gemmini configuration key (only valid for RTL/GL injection). See all available config keys in gemmini_config.py
#
gemmini_config_key="OSDIM8"

#
# The desired fault model
#
fault_model="rtl"

#
# An experiment description for bookkeeping
#
experiment_description="Standard sequential injection approach at RTL. Injection in the input registers"

#
# A simulation alias for bookkeeping - this is attatched to the report file names
#
sim_alias="simulation-xxx"

#
# The fault list. It must be located in the path fault_lists/$model
#
# RTL or Gate-level MAC unit fault list - this can also be used for RTL
#fault_list="fl_os_dim_4.csv"
fault_list="fl_os_dim_8.csv"

#
# The number of faults to be injected for each input in each target layer
#
injections=500

#
# The number of inputs per batch (16 is the best case for my pc)
#
batch_size=32

#
# The number batches
#
nbatches=20

#
# A simulation seed (this goes to the report file name)
#
seed=0

#
# The number of PyTorch inter and intra op threads (see https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cpu_threading_torchscript_inference.html)
# (set a huge value, e.g., 1000, to adjust to the max possible number)
#
inter_threads=16
intra_threads=16

#
# The model name and layers come from run.sh
#
model=$1
shift # remove $1, so now $1..$N are the layers

#
# This script's name
